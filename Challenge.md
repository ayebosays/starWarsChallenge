# Star Wars React Challenge
Goal: Create a React application that lists characters from the Star Wars series, using their publicly-available API

## Tools:
- Use a public GitHub repository
- Use Facebook's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) package
- Use **yarn** or **npm**
- Use React Hooks or Redux for state management
- Use the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)
- Use [The Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) to retrieve Star Wars entities

## Features:
- List Page
- Display a list of characters
- Each item in the list should display the character's name, birth year, height, and mass
- The list should use pagination with **next** / **prev** buttons
- Each item in the list should be clickable (use React router) and bring you to the Character Page
- Character Page
- Design and show all the properties of the character
- Add a back button that brings you back to the List page

## *Bonus Points*:
- Informative commits to Git to indicate progress
- Add a loading state / indicator when data is loading (both list and character)
- Use routing and / or state to ensure consistency between navigation of a Character Page and the List Page (if you click a character on the third page, and press back, it should return you to the third page)

## Submitting:
- Push your application to a public GitHub repository
- Please include a README as if it was for a production service

### Include the following items:
- Description of the problem and solution
- Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural
- Trade-offs you might have made
- Anything you left out
- what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project
